# Data Structure JS

My Implementation of some data structures using JavaScript

## notes on graph data structure

* Breadth first finds the shortest path to a target node
* Depth first finds any path to a target node
* Both only work when :
1. There are no loops
2. All edges have no weight
* Where BFS or DFS are not applicable, Dijkstra's Algorithm may be used
